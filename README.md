Quantum Anthology 🌌

Bridge to Bridge Studio Edition

"Building bridges between Art and Engineering."

Quantum Anthology is a digital art project that visualizes complex concepts of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and theoretical physics through 5 distinct Generative Art pieces, unified into a fluid experience. Developed using Processing (Java), this project interprets mathematical algorithms through an aesthetic lens.

🎨 The Anthology

This anthology symbolizes a journey stretching from the microcosm (subatomic particles) to the macrocosm (superclusters).

1. Is This Quantum Computing

Concept: String Theory & Irregularity

Description: A String Visualization inspired by the Spirohedron shape. It simulates the vibrational movement of strings and introduces an element of randomness similar to Vera Molnár's "1% disorder" algorithm, adding slight, artistic distortions to the structure.

2. Hypnotic Gluons Build Everything

Concept: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

Description: Inspired by the complex interactions of quarks and gluons. It represents the dynamic and ever-changing nature of gluon fields where particles oscillate and interact in a vibrant 3D space. (This piece has the shortest duration in the sequence to create a subliminal effect.)

3. Hypercube

Concept: 4th Dimension Geometry

Description: Represents the shadow of the fourth dimension (Tesseract) as a vibrating trace in three-dimensional space. It aims to make the quantum possibilities of geometry warping over time visible.

4. Orbit

Concept: Gravity & Spacetime Curvature

Description: Simulates gravitational points that bend and warp the fabric of the universe, redrawing the path of light. They leave vibrating traces on the scene as the architects of unseen cosmic flows.

5. Quantum Laniakea

Concept: Macro Structures & Cosmic Web

Description: Unites the chaotic vibrations of subatomic particles with the massive flows of the Laniakea Supercluster in the same cosmic breath. It makes the hidden rhythm of the universe visible through resonance across scales.

🛠 Technical Architecture (Engineering)

This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, reflecting Bridge to Bridge Studio's "Engineering-based Art" approach.

Scene Management System: Each artwork is derived from a Scene abstract class (Polymorphism). This allows new pieces to be added to the system modularly.

PGraphics Buffering: Each scene is not drawn directly to the screen but first to a virtual canvas (Off-screen buffer).

Smooth Transitions: Transitions between scenes are achieved smoothly by manipulating the alpha channels (transparency) of the buffered images (using tint and lerp logic).

Dynamic Timing: Each piece has its own unique duration. For example, the "Gluon" scene has a faster tempo, while other scenes remain on screen longer for the viewer to observe details.
